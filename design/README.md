# Introduction
IOT Cloud Framework is designed to fit in any possible electronic component so that it can be monitored and controlled remotely. This framework also provide integration with other services such as Google Home Assistant, Amazon Alexa, Microsoft Cortana, etc. There are lots of cloud solution available in market, using those are very costly, only way to bring down cost is design your own.

Design of Cloud has to be very efficient in terms of

- RAM memory usage
- CPU usage
- Bandwidth usage

Normally permanent storage is much cheaper hence we would be relaxed in it, but have to keep a note that it cannot grow beyond a point.

Three major component of IOT Cloud are:

1. [IOT Cloud](CLOUD.md)
2. Mobile App
3. IOT Device

Maintenance server that would require

1. [Log and monitor server](LOG.md)


Other framework

- [State management](STATEFRAMEWORK.md)
